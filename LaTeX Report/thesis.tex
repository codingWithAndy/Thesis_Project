		In your abstract you should aim to summarize the core contributions of your work in the context of the problem domain. Start by outlining the domain and the problems posed within it. Discuss how the methods you focus on approach the relevant problems. You should end your abstract by concretely stating the tangible outputs and deliverables you have created in order to complete your work on this document, and whether those outputs represent and improvement or alternative approach to existing methods. 
		
		Your abstract should be a couple or so paragraphs long, and roughly approximate the order and flow you then use for structuring the main document. If a viewer has read your abstract then they should already understand at a high level what it is you have created and delivered, and whether it is better than or comparable to existing methods. If your project is driven by a research hypothesis then the reader should know what that is at a high level from this section. Reading on, little should surprise the viewer.
		
		For paper submission of your thesis you should physically sign your name on each of the above declaration statements and date them in black ink. For digital submissions you should sign and date them digitally using a touch or stylus input if available. There are pieces of software that allow you to write directly on PDF documents, or alternatively you can bring a signature into your document as a figure with a transparent or white background. If you do not have a stylus input / tablet like device you should ask your supervisor, as many in the department do their grading / work on digital tablets.

% A long form dedication. 
	\begin{Acknowledgements}
		This is an opportunity to acknowledge and thank those who have supported you throughout your studies. Friends and colleagues who you have studied alongside, your families, and your mentors within the department are the usual suspects.
