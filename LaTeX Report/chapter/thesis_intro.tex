	Large documents can become cumbersome to work with and format consistently. Sensibly chosen aesthetic cues are important to help imply structure and can greatly aid the reader in understanding your work. The accompanying LaTeX template uses abstraction to hide the formatting from the author during content preparation, allowing for consistent styling to be applied automatically during document compilation. In this Google Docs theme it is the responsibility of the author to manually adhere to the styling laid out in this template.
