	\textbf{As part of our Masters of Science accreditation, we must complete a research thesis. In has been decided upon to create an educational game centred around Machine Learning (ML), due to the authors desire to gain a deeper understanding of ML and their previous experiences as being a secondary school teacher.} %% Taken from Spec
	
	\section{Overview of the Problem}
		\label{sec:overview_of_problem}
	
	%% Taken from the spec
	Machine learning gets perceived as a black box, a form of computer wizardry, where unknown algorithms do some magical unknown thing. Some misconceptions people have about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML is that 'AI does not need humans' and that 'AI is dangerous' \cite{quora5misconcepts}. Other misconceptions about AI and ML is that they have both very new and based around a human's brain, but AI and ML is something that has been around for a long time, and it is nowhere near the same, even at a fundamental level. Another big misconception is that AI is smarter than humans and that the ML robots will come and destroy the humans wiping out humanity. However, while AI can be better at performing specific tasks, they are not genetically more intelligent than humans. AI will only do what it gets told to do, nothing more \cite{quora5misconcepts}.
	
	On the other hand, instead of fearing AI and ML, there is a lot of this that it is currently doing to help humankind and make things safer. For example, the RAC, one of the UK's largest motoring organisations, aims to try and detect low-speed car crashes. They do this by developing an onboard crash sensing system that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to detect low-speed collisions and distinguish these events from more common driving events, such as driving over speed bumps or potholes. Independent tests showed the RAC system to be 92\% accurate in detecting test crashes, allowing them to be able to enable rapid response to roadside incidents \cite{matlanintrotoml}.

	\section{Overview of the Solution}
		\label{sec:overview_of_solution}
	%% Taken from the spec
	The overall aim of the proposed solution is to create a fun, educating game about ML. The players will be, at the core of the solution, playing a game that interacts with different ML models. The player(s) will be manipulating the game board and data points to affect the decision boundary, or to figure out where the decision boundary or centre of the cluster is. The solution will get created by using  Pygame and will have many different algorithms in the background, doing the main game mechanics, through using libraries like SKLearn \cite{sklearn_api} and Tensorflow \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}.

	\subsection{Aims \& Objectives}
		\label{sec:intro_objective} 
		
		%% Taken from the spec
		The proposed solution aims to create a fully interactive game that users will find fun and engaging, while still providing a level of education to teach the players what the different algorithms are and how they work. From the experience of being a teacher, learning has the most impact when the learner gets able to fully interact with the learning subject and see it work first hand, rather than just being told about it. The aim by creating this educational game is to help inform people what ML is and what it does, aiming to demystify the myths and misconceptions around ML.

		\label{sec:intro_contribs} 
		
		The main contributions of this work can be seen as follows:
		
		\begin{description}	
		
			\item[$\bullet$ A written thesis]\hfill
			
			A document that is indended to partner and explain aspects of the final application, explain decisions made and explain the research discovered to influence decisions. 
			
			\item[$\bullet$ An education game application about machine learning]\hfill
			
			An application created that allows the player or user to interact with, and manipulate, different machine learning models. Additional content, in the form of a website, has additionally been provided and hosted online. This supplementary content is to help with the teaching and learning of the main ML concepts used within the application.
