	Tables are also quite predictably captioned and formatted the same way. It is important to decide on a style for how you will organize your data and apply that style consistently for all of your tables. Table \ref{tbl:example_table} shows one possible way of styling your data but is by no means the only way of doing so neatly. Consistency is the key.
