	\subsection{Gamification}
	%%% From HCI Report
	We wanted to find out what the context of gamification is, and how it can be used within education, to take aspects of teaching and learning that can get brought into the 21st Century. To make aspects of education more accessible to students in a manner that they are more accustomed to in their everyday lives. 
	
	Gamification, a term first coined in 2002, is an HCI technique used to add a game layer to traditional non-game like situations. The gamification aims to create extrinsic motivators for a person to be encouraged to do particular actions. Each action, upon completion, will have a little reward which, upon doing so, will release dopamine into the brain. The release of dopamine creates a good feeling within the participant's mind, which in turn is encouraging them to do it again. These rewards can be in the form of badges, achievements or progress bars, to name a few.
	
	The term gamification first appeared in the context of software design in 2008 \cite{4}, but the term only started to get more widespread recognition within 2010. However, the term "gamification" was first coined by Nick Pelling in 2002 \cite{3e}. Its initial aim was to incorporate the social and reward features of games into the software. Gamification started to gain much attention, so much so that it got described by a venture capitalist as one of the most promising areas of gaming \cite{5}. Gamification is now known as a powerful tool for engagement, which has, since its initial conception, now become a standard feature within software development \cite{3e}. Researchers consider gamification to be the progression of earlier work that focuses on adopting game-design elements to non-game situations and contexts. Research in the HCI field, in regards to apps that use game-driven features for motivation and also in interface design, suggest that there is a connection between Soviet concepts of socialist competition and the American management trend of "fun at work" \cite{5}. 
	
	Jane McGonigal, in 2010, delivered a groundbreaking TED Talk titled, "Gaming Can Make a Better World' \cite{6}. This talk gets reflected as the defining moment in the history of gamification. Within the talk, she foretells a game based utopia. Where she states that "When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure: that we can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want, so I say: Let the world-changing games begin \cite{6}." Hindsight tells she was correct, as, from 2011, gamification starts to pick up steam.  At a Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) conference, a workshop titled "Gamification: Using Game Design Elements in Non-Gaming Contexts \cite{7}", which generated the Gamification Research Network (GRN) \cite{11}, in the year 2011. Through the years 2012 to 2016, gamification continues to grow. Even so, that gamification goes viral without people knowing through a game called Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is one of the most successful applications of gamification with over 800 million downloads. People who would usually turn their nose up at badge collecting were out patrolling the streets searching for rare Pokémon. Pokémon Go is one of the most successful apps of all time. It even broke records \cite{3e,8}. It could be said thanks to Pokémon Go, that gamification is now everywhere. Many established technology and other companies, including SAP AG, Microsoft, IBM, SAP, LiveOps, Deloitte, and other companies have started using gamification in various applications and processes \cite{9}. 
	
	The increased popularity in gamification, within some contexts, has had led to many legal restrictions be placed upon it, especially when linked to the Internet of Things (IoT) features. However, this mainly refers to the use of virtual currencies and assets, as well as data privacy, data protection and labour laws. These laws are due to its nature of being a data mining systems that spread information online, known as data aggregator \cite{10, 11}.

	\subsection{Gamification in Education}
	%%% Taken from HCI report
	The gamification of learning is an educational approach to motivate students to learn by using game elements in a learning environment \cite{22}. Gamification in education is very much the same thing as gamification in general, but with more of a focus on learning. However, gamification in learning has two main views within HCI academia. One side categories gamification of learning as learning that has game-like features, but only when the learning is happening in a non-game context, like a classroom. This version would involve a range of components that get presented in a system, or game layer, which aims to happen alongside the learning in a conventional classroom. At the same time, the other half includes games that have been designed to induced learning within them \cite{22}. 
	
	Gamification, within an educational or a learning situation, has multiple advantages. It is not just about trying to improve attendance with incentives by reaching a particular score, or extra rewards for completing specific tasks within a lesson. It can aid in cognitive development in adolescents, which can increase levels of engagement and can aid with accessibility within the classroom \cite{24}. Games that get produced for enhancing cognitive development are known as "rain games" \cite{24}. These popular games typically are focused around a series of questions and problems for the player to solve or answer. These games develop the rate the player can sustain information and increase the brain's ability to process information. The levels of the engagement of the students' increases, when gamification has been used, within a classroom. A study performed by scientists aimed to measure the students' levels of engagement in a classroom where gamification elements are applied \cite{25}. They assigned a point system to multiple daily activities. Every student had a measurement of the perceived level of engagement. The finding showed that the game like setting was supporting the learning within the classroom and increased productivity. Therefore, by increasing engagement levels, it also means it helps students be able to access the content of the lesson, that is or needs to be delivered better. 
	
	Even though gamification can aid teaching students of all needs, a study conducted on students who had autism using video games showed that this training package was powerful in teaching content that was age-appropriate \cite{26}. However, gamification of learning is not something just for the classroom; its an excellent tool for learning outside the classroom. Games like Spore create a deeper understanding of life and evolution as the game simulates a world where the player's character will evolve, adapting to their surroundings through reproduction. Another game by the same creator, Will Wright, Sim City aims to teach the player key skills like \cite{27}: Supply and demand; Budgeting; Urban planning; Managing the environment; Understanding utilities and services like transport systems and public services; Reading and maths skills. 
	
	Gamification of learning has excellent potential benefits. The benefits involve \cite{22}: Allowing students to have ownership of their learning, as well as giving opportunities for the learner to gain a sense of their' own identity" through alternative role-playing selves. The freedom, without any negative repercussions, to fail and keep on trying again. The ability to increase fun and joy while learning. The opportunity for tasks to be differentiated. Making the learning visible and providing opportunities to inspire intrinsic motivators for learning. Also, the ability to aiding in motivating students with low levels of motivation. %%%

	Gamification in Science
	\label{sec:game_in_science}
	
	Although science concepts still use more conventional styles of gamification. Science concepts will often use a type of gamification game that has a primary purpose, which is other than just for pure fun, called a 'serious' or 'applied' game. These types of games get utilised by industries like scientific exploration, education, health care, defence, emergency management, city planning, engineering and politics \cite{wikiserious}. Although not all do, serious games tend to share aspects closely tied with simulational games. However, all serious games still have other gamification features included (see fig: \ref{fig:seriousg}).
	
	Nonetheless, in regards to the field of science, serious games' role is to include crucial activities for scientists. These include outreach, teaching and research. With serious games on the increase, an emerging sub-genre is called citizen science games (CSGs) \cite{10seriousrules}. CSGs enables the user to produce as well as, or instead, analyse data for scientific use. Some examples of CSGs are GalaxyZoo, Foldit and HiRE-RNA \cite{follett2015analysis,mazzanti2017can}
	
	Studies suggest that there are ten main rules for serious games to follow. These are \cite{10seriousrules}:
	
	\begin{enumerate}		
		\item Define a serious goal - we must first define the purpose of the game at the beginning of its development. Is its purpose for science, outreach, teaching or a combination of all three? 
		
		\item Get the balance between entertainment and serious tasks - the game design should be implemented as a function of the objectives of the game. Therefore equilibrium and compromise need to be found between scientific accuracy and player accessibility.
		
		\item Allow the player to interact with the scientific data - players interest increases if they can interact with the science data, enriching the learning experience. The ability for players to generate data also creates another perspective for the player, increasing interaction.
		
		\item Promote onboarding and engagement - Expectations of players are varied. Therefore the reward system needs to be versatile. Ideally, the entry-level should be low and the difficulty altered to each player.
		
		\item Manage Information Flow - How the information to the play gets received will impact their behaviour, either positively or negatively. So if the focusing is on the outcome, this could influence the results.
		
		\item Provide an appropriate narrative - This is important for all games, but also crucial for serious games. The narrative should give the player context to the game, allowing them to know what to do.
		
		\item Adapt the level design - Depending on the objective, variation on level designs needs implementing. These can include duration, tasks and difficulty. 
		
		\item Develop good graphics that are not just pleasing on the eye - High-quality graphics increase the player's immersion into the game.
		
		\item Use all modalities, especially sound - Using just a visual channel can overload the player. Therefore it is vital to take the load of the player's vision and use several different channels — for example, sound.
		
		\item Iteratively assess what works and what does not - However, it is vital to take into account three different perspectives for serious games. The developer, the player and the scientist as they all have different views on what they believe the game needs adapting based on their desires.

	\subsection{Example Applications}
	

	\section{Machine Learning}
	
	\subsection{Machine Learning Fundamentals}
	
	
	\subsection{Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning}
	%%% Spec
	Machine learning uses two types of techniques: supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, and unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data \cite{geron2019hands}. \\
	\\
	\textbf{Supervised:} \\
	Supervised machine learning aims to build a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. The supervised learning algorithm takes the insights it has gained, from a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output), also known as labels, and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data \cite{matlanintrotoml, geron2019hands}. 
	
	Supervised learning uses classification and regression techniques to develop predictive models. Classification is a technique that predicts discrete responses. The classification aims to classify the inputted data into different categories\cite{matlanintrotoml}. Some examples of this type of technique are deciding if an email is spam or not, or deciding if a patient has a benign or cancerous tumour. These types of applications include credit scoring, medical imaging and speech recognition.
	
	On the other hand, regression techniques try to predict continuous responses \cite{geron2019hands}. An excellent example of this is to check for changes in the temperature or checking the power demands fluctuations. This kind of applications would get used for trading and forecasting electricity load \cite{matlanintrotoml}. \\
	\\
	\textbf{Unsupervised Learning:} \\
	Unsupervised learning aims to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data \cite{geron2019hands}. In the same regards as supervised learning, unsupervised learning aims to gain insights from the data. However, whereas supervised learning has the output labels for the provided dataset, unsupervised does not, it aims to explore the data to find patterns or groupings in the data \cite{matlanintrotoml}.
	
	Examples of clustering applications include gene sequence analysis, market research, and object recognition \cite{matlanintrotoml}.

	\subsection{Methods}
	
	\subsubsection{K-Means}
	\subsubsection{Gaussian Mixture Model}
	\subsubsection{Neural Network}
	%%% Spec
	Linear regression is a model that aims to fit a line of best fit to the data provided \cite{geron2019hands, sklearn_lr}.  A requirement for linear regression is for a set of methods intended for regression in which the target value expects to be a linear combination of the features. In mathematical notation, if $\hat{y}$ is the predicted value. $\hat{y}(w,x)=w_0+w_1x_1+...+w_px_p$
	Across the module, we designate the vector $w=(w_1,...,w_p)$ as the coefficient and w0 as the intercept \cite{sklearn_lr}
	
	LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients $w=(w_1,...,w_p)$ to minimise the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation \cite{sklearn_lr}. To achieve the best fit to the dataset the algorithm chooses the best overall score from the 'Root Mean Square Error' (RMSE). Therefore, to train a linear regression model, we need to find the value of $0$ that minimises the RMSE \cite{geron2019hands}.
	%%%
	Mathematically it solves a problem of the form \cite{sklearn_lr}:
	$\min\limits_{w} = ||Xw-y||^2_2$
	
	The coefficient estimates for linear regression rely on the independence of the features. When features are correlated, and the columns of the design matrix $X$ have an approximate linear dependence, the design matrix becomes close to the singular, which causes the least-squares estimate to become highly sensitive to random errors in the observed target, which in turn produces a large variance. This situation of multicollinearity can arise, for example, when data get collected without an experimental design \cite{sklearn_lr, geron2019hands}.
	
	\subsubsection{Logistic Regression}
	%%% Spec
	\textbf{Logistic regression} is an algorithm that gets used for classification. Logistic regression gets used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. If the estimated probability is greater than 50\%, the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class. If the model has predicted that the instance belongs to that class, also known as the positive class, it gets a '1' label \cite{handsonbook}. 
	%%%
	
	\subsubsection{SVM}
	%%% Spec
	Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile ML model. The model is capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression and even outlier detection \cite{geron2019hands, sklearn_svm}. This model is one of the most popular ML models and is best suited for small to medium-sized datasets. The model aims to separate the data categories by using a decision boundary, with the largest margin between them. Due to the model using a large margin to separate the data, the algorithm gets known as the 'large margin classification' \cite{geron2019hands}.
	%%%
	
	SVMs are a set of supervised learning methods and have many advantages, especially when working in high dimensional spaces. SVMs are also useful in situations where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. Due to the model using subsets of the training points in the decision function, the model is memory efficient, and it is very versatile. The model is very versatile due to the different kernel functions are can be used \cite{sklearn_svm}. Although the model does have many strengths, it does also have a few disadvantages. A disadvantage is if the number of features is considerably greater than the number of data samples, then overfitting can happen. A way to overcome this is to choose different kernel functions, and regularisation of the term is crucial. Another disadvantage is that SVMs do not provide probability estimates. These estimates get calculated by using an expensive five-fold cross-validation \cite{sklearn_svm}.

	\section{Proposed Solution}
	% Taken from spec
	The overall aim of the proposed solution is to create a fun, educating game about ML. The players will be, at the core of the solution, playing a game that interacts with different ML models. The player(s) will be manipulating the game board and data points to affect the decision boundary, or to figure out where the decision boundary or centre of the cluster is. The solution will get created by using  Pygame and will have many different algorithms in the background, doing the main game mechanics, through using libraries like SKLearn \cite{sklearn_api} and Tensorflow \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}.
