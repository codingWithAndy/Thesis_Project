                        In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks[1]) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories
                        by Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Vapnik et al., 1997), it presents one of the most robust prediction methods, based on the statistical learning framework or VC theory proposed by Vapnik and Chervonekis
                        (1974) and Vapnik (1982, 1995). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other,
                        making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped
                        so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on the side of the gap on which
                        they fall.

                        Regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables. Let’s understand this with an easy example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Let’s imagine you want to estimate growth in sales of a company based on current economic conditions. You have the recent company data, which indicates that the growth in sales is around two and a half times the growth in the economy.
                            </li>
                            <li>Using this insight, we can predict future sales of the company based on current and past information.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple benefits of using regression analysis. They are as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It indicates the significant relationships between the dependent variable and independent variable.
                            </li>
                            <li>It shows the strength of the impact of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regression analysis also allows us to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales, such as the effect of price changes and the number of promotional activities. These benefits help market researchers/data analysts/data scientists to
                        eliminate and evaluate the best set of variables to get used for building predictive models.
