                    Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm. Linear regression is useful for 
                    modelling the relationships between a dependent variable and one or several independent variables. 
                    The purpose of linear regression is to discover (and quantify the strength of) significant 
                    correlations between dependent and independent variables.

                <p>
                    Supervised machine learning is the term used when the dataset provided has labels. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different types of supervised learning algorithms which can get split into two 
                    main categories.

                    Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between 
                    a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique gets used for forecasting, 
                    time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. For example, the 
                    relationship between rash driving and the number of road accidents by a driver is studied best through regression.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Regression analysis is an essential tool for modelling and analysing data. Here, we fit a curve/line to the data 
                    points, in such a way that the differences between the distances of data points from the curve/line get minimised.

                <h2>Why do we use Regression Analysis?</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="textBackgroundLight">
                <p>
                    Regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables. Let’s understand this with an easy example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Let’s imagine you want to estimate growth in sales of a company based on current economic conditions. You have the 
                            recent company data, which indicates that the growth in sales is around two and a half times the growth in the economy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Using this insight, we can predict future sales of the company based on current and past information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are multiple benefits of using regression analysis. They are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>It indicates the significant relationships between the dependent variable and independent variable.</li>
                        <li>It shows the strength of the impact of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regression analysis also allows us to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales, such as 
                    the effect of price changes and the number of promotional activities. These benefits help market 
                    researchers/data analysts/data scientists to eliminate and evaluate the best set of variables to get used 
                    for building predictive models.
