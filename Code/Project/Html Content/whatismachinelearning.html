                <p>
                    Machine Learning is the science and, claimed by most, the art of programming computers so they can learn from data as is explained in the two quotes below, with the first one being a slightly more general definition and the second a more engineering-orientated
                    one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, machine learning is algorithms that get used to find and apply patterns in data. And they pretty much run the world. Most of the advancements of artificial intelligence progress are thanks to Machine Learning algorithms.

                    Even though Machine Learning is a Computer Science field of study, it is, however, very deep in similarity with the world of statistics. A lot of the Machine Learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in the massive amounts of data. The data
                    can contain a lot of things, including numbers, words, images, clicks and many more. If it can be stored digitally, it can get fed into a Machine Learning algorithm
                </p>

                <p>
                    Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today—recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like
                    Siri and Alexa. The list goes on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each platform is collecting as much data about you as possible—what genres you like watching, what links you are clicking, which statuses you are reacting to—and using machine learning to make a highly educated guess about what you might want next. In
                    the case of a voice assistant, about which words match best with the funny sounds coming out of your mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The art of Machine Learning is quite basic: find the pattern, apply the pattern. However, it pretty much runs the world. That’s in big part thanks to an invention in 1986, courtesy of Geoffrey Hinton, today he is known as the father of deep learning.
