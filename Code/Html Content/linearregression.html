            Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm. Linear regression is useful for 
            modelling the relationships between a dependent variable and one or several independent variables. 
            The purpose of linear regression is to discover (and quantify the strength of) significant 
            correlations between dependent and independent variables.

        <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>

        <p>
            Supervised machine learning is the term used when the dataset provided has labels. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many different types of supervised learning algorithms which can get split into two 
            main categories.
        </p>

            These are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Regression</b>: Linear Regression; Logistic Regression; Polynomial Regression; Stepwise Regression; Ridge Regression; Lasso Regression; ElasticNet Regression; Decision Trees.</li>
                <li><b>Classification</b>: k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN); Support Vector Machines (SVMs); Decision Trees; Neural Networks.</li>

        <h2>What is Regression Analysis?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="textBackgroundLight">
    
        <p>
            Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between 
            a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique gets used for forecasting, 
            time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. For example, the 
            relationship between rash driving and the number of road accidents by a driver is studied best through regression.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Regression analysis is an essential tool for modelling and analysing data. Here, we fit a curve/line to the data 
            points, in such a way that the differences between the distances of data points from the curve/line get minimised.

        <h2>Why do we use Regression Analysis?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textBackgroundLight">
        <p>
            Regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables. Let’s understand this with an easy example:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Let’s imagine you want to estimate growth in sales of a company based on current economic conditions. You have the 
                    recent company data, which indicates that the growth in sales is around two and a half times the growth in the economy.
                </li>
                <li>Using this insight, we can predict future sales of the company based on current and past information.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are multiple benefits of using regression analysis. They are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>It indicates the significant relationships between the dependent variable and independent variable.</li>
                <li>It shows the strength of the impact of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Regression analysis also allows us to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales, such as 
            the effect of price changes and the number of promotional activities. These benefits help market 
            researchers/data analysts/data scientists to eliminate and evaluate the best set of variables to get used 
            for building predictive models.
