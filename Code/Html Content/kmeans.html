    <h1>K-Means</h1>
    <div class="textBackground">
        <p>K-Means is known as an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. K-Means aim is to cluster data points together based on their values within the decision boundaries.</p>

        <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>

        <p>Unsupervised machine learning is the term used when the dataset provided has no labels. The aim of the unsupervised models is then to gain insights, from the data, without a teacher.</p>

    <div class="textBackground">
    <p>There are many different types of unsupervised learning algorithms which can get split into four main categories.</br>
    These are:
    <uo>
        <li><b>Clustering</b> - K-Means; DBSCAN; Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA); Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).</li>
        <li><b>Anomaly Detection and Novelty Detection</b> - One-class SVM; Isolation Forrest.</li>
        <li><b>Visualisation and Dimensionality Reduction</b> - Principal Component Analysis (PCA); Kernel PCA; Locally Linear Embedding (LLE); t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE).</li>
        <li><b>Association Rule Learning</b> - Apriori; Eclat.</li>

        <h2>What is the Purpose of Clustering?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="textBackground">
        <p>The purpose of clustering is to allow the ability to make sense of large datasets possible, by extracting values from large sets of either structured or unstructured data. 
            Like in life, when you are trying to complete a big task, it is always better to slip the tasks up into similar groups. Well, this is what clustering is doing with your data, sorting it out. 
            Grouping similar data attributes, to create some logical groupings, which will then aim to allow the user to attempt then to analyse it.<p>
    
        <p><b>Clustering</b> allows you to take a sweeping glance at your dataset. By doing this, this will then allow you to form some insights/logical structures based on what you have found in the data. 
            Therefore, allowing you to have a good idea of what you will find within the data, before going deeper into it and exploring more of it through further analysis. </p>

        <p>In a nutshell, clusters are sets of data points that share similar attributes. While clustering algorithms are tools to help group these data points, into clusters, based their similarities.</p>
